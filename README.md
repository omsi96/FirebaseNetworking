# FirebaseNetworking
This repository will include some Models and Networking calls to firebase to make the process easy for anyone to make simple calls using firebase 

Include these to your pod file
```
  pod 'Firebase/Storage'
  pod 'Firebase/Auth'
  pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
  pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
  pod 'CodableFirebase'
```

For now, I have included 3 files only for Authentication (signing in, signing up and forgot password) 
## Auth

Check the Networking Test file to see examples
